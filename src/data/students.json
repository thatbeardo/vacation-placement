There was a flow to the course which helped build upon previous concepts. Each new concept was cemented through the respective assignments. The weekely coding tests were a great way to stay in touch and get some real practice. All in all, C2C was a huge help in landing the placement that I did and I encourage every junior to join in!"

C2C helped me make sense of three years' worth of knowledge received in college and taught me which topics to study and how much. The technical training provided was top rate and it was given in a way that was easy to understand and remember. Soft skills were my weakness, but C2C taught me the rules so well. Excelling in soft skills is all about following the rules and etiquettes. And once C2C gave them to me, it was easy. Thank you, C2C!"

      "I took vacation placement training under Harshil in Summer of 2015. The course was excellent, I was introduced to many unknown concepts of Java. Also the way he taught was quite amazing, concepts that I already knew were taught with intuitive examples which was fun to learn and easy to remember. Weekly tests helped us with the revision of the things taught till that time. I was also introduced to codechef by him which is an excellent OJ. He discussed various problems of codechef in class and encouraged us to solve more and more which helped me and my friends clear the coding rounds. Never did I feel hesitant about asking doubts no matter how silly they were! It was more of a friend sharing his knowledge than a lecture! I am truly grateful to him for what I achieved!"

After a few months of being their volunteer in 2015, a student from the class asked me which company I was placed in! Both of us were gobsmacked! He was because I told him I’m just in FE yet & I was because that question really made me realize what Harshil & Havan had helped me be capable of. The journey ever since has been immense and it wouldn’t have been possible without all that I’ve learnt from them. Not just in landing a dream job, but in every step of the way, the lessons learnt & emphasized in C2C came to the rescue. It is undoubtedly the quintessential learning experience that each one of us can benefit from!"

The way Havan made me feel about Java..If you feel even half those things for a girl, believe me, she's the one :P Jokes aside, this was the best teaching-learning experience of my life. Helped massively in placements of course but more importantly it was a reminder of two things. One, you don't nearly know as much as you think you do. Two, it's actually REALLY fun and not that complicated. I will also never forget Harshil's introduction to Hash Maps. He almost had a romantic relationship with the topic :P In summary, campus to corporate was an invaluable experience and I can only feel sorry for those who missed it."

They literally made me fall in love with coding and java. The course curriculum is sufficient for any company that comes to our campus.

Starting from the first lecture, I knew this course is really different from what we usually experience! We were grilled for good with coding on Hackerrank with weekly tests.
