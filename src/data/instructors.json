    "about": "See that picture above? That's me leading a team of Marines in Siberia 12 years back. Our mission was to rescue an individual whose name cannot be disclosed. After Siberia, I carried out more than 150 covert operations around the globe. That's when I realized my leadership potential. After my last operation in Iran, I was severely injured. I had to travel to Nepal where I met a group of monks who taught me the art of programming. One day as we were training in the sacred temple of the compilers, we were attacked by a group of Management Extremists. I survived the attack but my guru could not. I still remember her last words as she lay dying in my arms  'You're the chosen one. You must teach programming to people who have strayed from their path. Win this battle and encourage people to embrace technology. And you have an amazing beard'. And here I am. Honoring my master's last wish."

    "about": "This is really annoying. This idiot does not understand that he is just 24 and he claims to have executed that operation 12 years back. Which means he was just 12. WHICH MAKES NO SENSE. Pretty sure he can't walk for 5 continuous minutes without losing his breath. Wait a minute. Why am I even paying attention to his fables. And what the hell is Unemployed at Useless?!! I was a tech analyst at Morgan Stanley! That's more than he has ever achieved!!!!!. *Calms down* Hello, my name is Havan and you cannot sing the Havan Karenge song when you see me over Skype. I hold a Master's Degree in Data Science earned at the University of Washington. Currently, I am a software developer at google. I love and enjoy teaching and I have realized that the concepts you are about to learn, as part of the programme, are widely sought after here too. So, if you are planning to pursue your Master's degree, this course will give you a much required edge. "

    "about": "Putting up with these two is painful. At the same time, watching them quarrel over the most insignificant of things is amazing. Hi! I am Devika and I am the latest addition to their team. However, I have been watching them rock it since 2015. Harshil did not allow me to write more here. Damn that prick"
